Command: docker run
Explanation: The 'docker run' command is used to run a container from an image
Example: docker run nginx


Command: docker ps 
Explanation: The 'docker ps' lists all running containers and some basic information about them


Command: docker ps -a
Explanation: This command lists all running as well as previously stopped or exited containers


Command: docker stop
Explanation: Use this command to stop a running containers, provide eithter the container ID or name
Example: docker stop silly_sammet


Command: docker rm 
Explanation: Use this command to remove a stopped/exited container in order to free up the space
Example: docker rm silly_sammet


Command: docker images
Explanation: Run this command to see the list of all available images


Command: docker rmi
Explanation: Run this command to remove an image. But ensure that no container is running out of that 
image before you delete. You have to stop and delete all dependent container (either running or stopped)
to be able to delete an image.
Example: docker rmi nginx


Command: docker pull
Explanation: Use this command to only download an image
Example: docker pull nginx


A container only lives as long as the process inside it is alive. This is why when you run a container
from an Ubuntu image it stops immediately because Ubuntu is just an image of an OS that is used as
the base image for other applications. There is no process/application running in it by default.


Append a command
Example: docker run ubuntu sleep 5


Command: exec
Explanation: Use this command to execute a command on a running container
Example: docker exec {container_name} cat /etc/hosts


Command: attach and detach
Explanation: When you run 'docker run {image_name}', it runs the container in the foreground or in an
attached mode, meaning you will be attached to the console or the standard out of the docker container
and you will see the output of the web service on your screen. Another option is to run the docker
container in the detached mode by providing the -d option. If you would like to attach to the running
container later, run the docker attach command
Example: docker run -d {image_name}; docker attach {container_id}
