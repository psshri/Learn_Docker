Docker images are stored in a docker registry. A docker registry is a central repository of all Docker
images

docker run nginx
docker run docker.io/nginx/nginx

You can login to your private docker registry via following command
Command: docker login private-registry.io

Also, always login first before pulling or pushing from/to a private registry

How to deploy a private registry of your own?

The docker registry is itself another application and is available as a docker image, the name of the
image is registry and it exposes the API on port 5000. Use the following command to run the private 
registry container.
Command: docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name registry registry:2
Now, how do you push your own image to this? Use the docker image tag command to tag the image with a 
private registry url in it. In this case since it is running on the same host, we can use the localhost
Command: docker image tag my-image localhost:5000/my-image
Now we can push our image to our local private registry using the docker push command
Command: docker push localhost:5000/my-image
We can pull the image using the following command
Command: docker pull localhost:5000/my-image
Command: docker pull 192.168.56.100/my-image
